Welcome to Copy Hai JI - Document Upload System

This is a test document to demonstrate the document upload and embedding functionality.

Key Features:
- Document upload with drag and drop interface
- Automatic embedding creation using HuggingFace transformers
- Support for multiple file formats: PDF, TXT, MD, CSV
- Configurable chunk size and overlap settings
- Real-time progress tracking
- Beautiful and modern UI design

Technical Details:
The system uses FAISS for vector storage and retrieval, allowing for efficient similarity search.
Documents are processed using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to create meaningful chunks.
The embedding model used is sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for high-quality embeddings.

Use Cases:
1. Knowledge base creation
2. Document search and retrieval
3. Question answering systems
4. Content analysis and similarity matching

This document will be processed into embeddings that can be used for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.
